Head spinning in a caffeinated fugue,**Kevin Bennett** once found himself shredding down a Martian ski slope with a thousand irate **Nephilim** howling in his wake. On the way, he rescued twenty damsels, had lunch, and fully calculated **Pi**. In close company, he goes by "**Bennett**," but he moonlights as an accordion-bearing **comedian** with an eye-patch and a beret, who goes by "**French Accent**." He entertains any crowd, be it young, old, clean or "adult". His technique involves regular crowd participation and a musical element with no contemporary parallel. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/36b0b2eb-5e2b-4bbb-afea-bfa1829dca6c.jpg)

Email the offices of **French Accent** at clarkstaplesbennett@gmail.com for booking information.  In addition to regularly performing as a **headline comedian** throughout the **midwest** and **northwest **via **bookers** such as **TribbleRun****Entertainment**, **Summit, Entertainment Max, Roger Paul, and Charter Talent **(Hey, don't y'all judge me! Guy's gotta eat, right?)******Bennett** works in capacity as a **host** and **feature ****comedian**. He's performed comedy in**half the continental United States**, and is regularly a crowd favorite. He's made **three television appearances** in the last year, including **The Gameshow Network's "It Takes A Church"**, as well as promotional local news appearances prior shows. (Hey, they count. Yeesh, I'm working with **Charter**, what do you expect?) If interested, send an e-mail and he'll get back to you **within 24 hours**.****

**Kevin Bennett** is a **Colorado Comedian**. Among **Fort Collins Comedians, Be****nnett's** built up a slight following. Mainly, they're hoping to catch him in an alley and bop him on the head with a blunt instrument; but everybody's got to start somewhere**.  **

He is also a **novelist**; but that's for [another part ][0]of the website.
