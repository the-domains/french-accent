Head spinning in a caffeinated fugue, Kevin Bennett once found himself shredding down a Martian ski slope with a thousand irate Nephilim howling in his wake. On the way, he rescued twenty damsels, had lunch, and fully calculated Pi. In close company, he goes by "Bennett," but he moonlights as an accordion-bearing comedian with an eye patch and a beret, who goes by "French Accent." He entertains any crowd, employs techniques that involve a great deal of crowd participation, and brings music to his comedy in a unique way that has no contemporary parallel.   
Email Kevin Bennett at clarkstaplesbennett@gmail.com for booking information.  In addition to headlining, Bennett works in capacity as a host and feature comedian. He's performed comedy in half the continental United States, and is regularly a crowd favorite. If interested, send an e-mail and he'll get back to you within 24 hours. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/767e874f-de75-49e3-98ef-1accffbeeb1e.jpg)
